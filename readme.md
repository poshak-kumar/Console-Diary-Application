### Detailed Explanation of this Personal Diary Application in Java Project

This project simulates a simple personal diary, where a user can create, view, edit, delete, and list diary entries stored in text files using Java's file handling mechanisms. Let’s walk through the code step-by-step, explaining each part in detail.

---

### **Imports Section**

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner;
```

- **`import java.io.*;`**: This imports all the classes from the `java.io` package, which provides various classes for input and output operations. Classes like `File`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedWriter`, `BufferedReader`, etc., are used for file handling in this project.
  
- **`import java.util.Scanner;`**: The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user via the console. We use it to handle user interaction (e.g., asking for dates, diary content).

---

### **Main Class: `PersonalDiary`**

```java
public class PersonalDiary {
    private static final String DIARY_PATH = "diary_entries/";
```

- **Class Declaration**: `PersonalDiary` is the main class that encapsulates the entire functionality of the project.
  
- **`private static final String DIARY_PATH = "diary_entries/";`**: This constant defines the folder where diary entries are saved. It's marked as `static final`, meaning it's a constant and will be the same for all instances of the class. The path is relative to where the Java program is run, and the program will create this directory if it doesn't exist.

---

### **Main Method**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    File dir = new File(DIARY_PATH);
    if (!dir.exists()) {
        dir.mkdir(); // Create directory if it doesn't exist
    }
```

- **`public static void main(String[] args)`**: This is the entry point of the Java application. The `main` method is where the program execution begins.

- **`Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);`**: This creates a `Scanner` object to handle input from the user via the console.

- **`File dir = new File(DIARY_PATH);`**: A `File` object is created that points to the directory where diary entries are stored. The `File` class represents files and directories in the filesystem.

- **`if (!dir.exists()) { dir.mkdir(); }`**: This checks if the diary directory exists. If not, it creates the directory using `mkdir()`.

---

### **User Interaction Loop**

```java
while (true) {
    System.out.println("Personal Diary Application");
    System.out.println("1. Create New Entry");
    System.out.println("2. View Entry");
    System.out.println("3. Edit Entry");
    System.out.println("4. Delete Entry");
    System.out.println("5. List All Entries");
    System.out.println("6. Exit");
    System.out.print("Enter your choice: ");
    int choice = scanner.nextInt();
    scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline
```

- **`while (true)`**: An infinite loop is used to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to exit.
  
- **`System.out.println(...);`**: Displays the main menu options to the user.

- **`int choice = scanner.nextInt();`**: Reads the user's menu choice as an integer. 
  
- **`scanner.nextLine();`**: Consumes the leftover newline character from the user input to prevent input issues when using `nextLine()` later.

---

### **Menu Switch Statement**

```java
switch (choice) {
    case 1 -> createEntry(scanner);
    case 2 -> viewEntry(scanner);
    case 3 -> editEntry(scanner);
    case 4 -> deleteEntry(scanner);
    case 5 -> listEntries();
    case 6 -> System.exit(0);
    default -> System.out.println("Invalid choice!");
}
```

- **`switch (choice)`**: Based on the user's input, the program calls the corresponding method to handle the request.

- **`case 1 -> createEntry(scanner);`**: If the user chooses option 1, the program calls the `createEntry()` method to create a new diary entry.

- **`case 2 -> viewEntry(scanner);`**: Option 2 calls the `viewEntry()` method to view an existing diary entry.

- **`case 3 -> editEntry(scanner);`**: Option 3 calls the `editEntry()` method to edit an existing entry.

- **`case 4 -> deleteEntry(scanner);`**: Option 4 calls the `deleteEntry()` method to delete an entry.

- **`case 5 -> listEntries();`**: Option 5 calls the `listEntries()` method to list all diary entries.

- **`case 6 -> System.exit(0);`**: Option 6 exits the program using `System.exit()`.

- **`default -> System.out.println("Invalid choice!");`**: If the user enters a number not listed in the menu, an error message is displayed.

---

### **Method 1: Create New Entry**

```java
private static void createEntry(Scanner scanner) throws IOException {
    System.out.print("Enter date (YYYY-MM-DD): ");
    String date = scanner.nextLine();
    File file = new File(DIARY_PATH + "diary_" + date + ".txt");

    if (file.exists()) {
        System.out.println("Entry already exists for this date.");
        return;
    }

    System.out.println("Write your diary entry: ");
    String content = scanner.nextLine();

    try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file))) {
        writer.write(content);
        System.out.println("Diary entry saved successfully!");
    }
}
```

- **Purpose**: This method allows the user to create a new diary entry.

- **`String date = scanner.nextLine();`**: The user is prompted to input a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. This date is used as part of the filename for the diary entry.

- **`File file = new File(DIARY_PATH + "diary_" + date + ".txt");`**: A `File` object is created that points to the new diary file.

- **`if (file.exists()) { return; }`**: If a file with the same date already exists, the method returns early, avoiding overwriting the existing file.

- **`BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file));`**: The `BufferedWriter` is used to write text to the file efficiently. The `FileWriter` is wrapped in a `BufferedWriter` to handle the actual writing.

- **`writer.write(content);`**: The content entered by the user is written to the file.

- **`try-with-resources`**: The `try` block ensures that the `BufferedWriter` is automatically closed when done, freeing system resources.

---

### **Method 2: View an Entry**

```java
private static void viewEntry(Scanner scanner) throws IOException {
    System.out.print("Enter date (YYYY-MM-DD): ");
    String date = scanner.nextLine();
    File file = new File(DIARY_PATH + "diary_" + date + ".txt");

    if (!file.exists()) {
        System.out.println("No entry found for this date.");
        return;
    }

    try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file))) {
        String line;
        System.out.println("Diary Entry for " + date + ":");
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println(line);
        }
    }
}
```

- **Purpose**: This method allows the user to view an existing diary entry.

- **`BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));`**: The `BufferedReader` is used to read the contents of the file line by line. `FileReader` opens the file for reading.

- **`while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null)`**: This loop reads each line of the file and prints it until the end of the file is reached.

---

### **Method 3: Edit an Entry**

```java
private static void editEntry(Scanner scanner) throws IOException {
    System.out.print("Enter date (YYYY-MM-DD): ");
    String date = scanner.nextLine();
    File file = new File(DIARY_PATH + "diary_" + date + ".txt");

    if (!file.exists()) {
        System.out.println("No entry found for this date.");
        return;
    }

    System.out.println("Current entry:");
    viewEntry(scanner);

    System.out.println("Enter new content to append:");
    String newContent = scanner.nextLine();

    try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file, true))) {
        writer.newLine();
        writer.write(newContent);
        System.out.println("Entry updated successfully!");
    }
}
```

- **Purpose**: This method allows the user to append new content to an existing diary entry.

- **`new FileWriter(file, true)`**: The `true` argument means that the file will be opened in append mode, so new content is added at the end rather than overwriting the file.

- **`writer.newLine()`**: Adds a new line before writing the new content, ensuring that the new content starts on a fresh line.

---

### **Method 4: Delete an Entry**

```java
private static void deleteEntry(Scanner scanner) {
    System.out.print("Enter date (YYYY-MM-DD): ");
    String date = scanner.nextLine();
    File file = new File(DIARY_PATH + "diary

_" + date + ".txt");

    if (file.delete()) {
        System.out.println("Diary entry for " + date + " deleted.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("No entry found for this date.");
    }
}
```

- **Purpose**: This method allows the user to delete a diary entry (file).

- **`file.delete()`**: Deletes the file. If the file doesn't exist, the method returns `false`, and an error message is displayed.

---

### **Method 5: List All Entries**

```java
private static void listEntries() {
    File dir = new File(DIARY_PATH);
    File[] files = dir.listFiles((d, name) -> name.endsWith(".txt"));

    if (files != null && files.length > 0) {
        System.out.println("All Diary Entries:");
        for (File file : files) {
            System.out.println(file.getName());
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println("No diary entries found.");
    }
}
```

- **Purpose**: This method lists all diary entries by listing the files in the `diary_entries` directory.

- **`dir.listFiles((d, name) -> name.endsWith(".txt"))`**: Filters the files to only list `.txt` files in the directory.

---

### **Conclusion**

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of Java’s file handling capabilities, including:
- File creation and deletion.
- Reading from and writing to files.
- Managing directories.
- Using `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` for efficient file I/O.

Each method encapsulates a specific functionality related to diary management, ensuring modularity and clarity.
